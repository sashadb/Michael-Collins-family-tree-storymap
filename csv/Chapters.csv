Pavee Roads Homes ",https://www.paveepoint.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NO-FEE-2-NLI-Pavee-Point-family-history.jpg,Source: Pavee Point website photo by Mark Stedman,,"In 2019 I, Michael Collins, along with the Pavee Point Men’s Health Group, began a research project called Pavee Roads Home. This involved researching and documenting important historical information relating to Irish travellers as well as working with genealogist Tony Hennessy from the National Library to research and develop their family trees. The project was supported by Seamus Nolan, Derek Spiers, Brian Fleming, Andy O'Hara, Dublin City Council Culture Company and The National Library.
<br><br>
As part of the project, I researched my family tree. This storymap is a presentation of part of my family tree -- the Collins line. The storymap tells the story of my father, and my father's father, and my father's grandfather, and tells stories of one journey in Michael's family, from Ballinasloe to Cara Park, Coolock.

2. Michael Collins,media/storymap 1.jpg,,,"I was born in Dublin on the 10th of December 1987 to my parents Hughie and Mary Collins.I am a men's health worker at Pavee Point. I married Margaret O'Donnell, and we live in Coolock and have three children--Sophie, Hughie, and Davie Collins. About working on Pavee Roads Home: <blockquote>In conducting this research into our own family histories, we discovered strong connections to the Connacht Rangers. This is something we never knew and reveals a lot about Travellers contribution to society and it really makes me proud.</blockquote>

<p class='description'>
Cara Park in Coolock:
<blockquote>When that site was built it was built for the people that lived in Finglas so a lot of the Travellers moved over from Finglas, but that site at that time was in the middle of a wood, it was almost in the middle of a wood, there was no shops there was no, only like a booreen road coming up to it and that's where they built the site for the Travellers in Finglas to move over, and we did, sure we did. Molly, I remember Davy Collins and Molly moving over, me mother and father, to the tigins. But they didn't like it cause it was very isolated and there was no one around and it was very lonesome and they didn't like it and so everyone moved back over to the tigens in Finglas, but some stayed in it and then more people came from England and around the country and that’s why Cara Park is there now, and its over crowded.</br>-Mary Brigid Collins</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
That side of the road was all flat along and the wagons would park in longways with the forks facing up the way so when you light the fire you could sit in the mouth of the wagon or the tent and warm up. So each person had their tent or their wagon facing each other with the fire in between. The side of the road was completely flat there's hills there now, they did that in the 70’s or 80’s purposefully to stop the Travellers from pulling in to camp, so this is how the block of cement for the bottom of the pump isn't there, ya wont find it cause it's covered. They'd pull there cause of the wind and that, on both sides ya had the big ditch and it would block the wind from coming in on top of ya. What they used to do and I remember it very clearly, they'd watch for the farmer, there was a farmer down here I think it was the left or the right and he used to come that way and he used to carry the milk, me granny old Biddy would come out with a burner that they made of copper, the farmer would get out and the fresh milk he'd pour it in and fill it for her. The freshest of milk.
I remember bringing me father here 25 years ago and the pump was there and the base was there, then I was back me and my wife about 10 or 12 years ago the pump was gone but the base was there.<br>- Hughie Collins</blockquote><a class= ""go-to"" href=""#pagetop"">Go to top</a>",,Plain,,53.343033,-6.954504,,,,,,,
